         <h2>What is Pen to Voice?</h2>
         <p>Pen to Voice is a handwritten to audiobook conversion project. It allows users to convert their handwritten notes, essays, and documents into an audiobook format, which can be listened to on the go. This project aims to provide an accessible way for individuals who have difficulty reading or are visually impaired to access written material.</p>
         <h2>How it works</h2>
         <p>The Pen to Voice project uses advanced machine learning algorithms to recognize handwriting and convert it into a digital format. Once the handwriting has been digitized, it is converted into an audiobook format, which can be listened to using a standard audio player. Users can upload their handwritten notes or documents to the Pen to Voice website, and within minutes, they will receive an audiobook version of their material.</p>
         <h2>Upload your documents</h2>
         <p>To convert your handwritten notes or documents into an audiobook, simply upload them using the form below:</p>
